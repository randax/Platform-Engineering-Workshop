# Module 05 — Break it, diagnose it, verify the diagnosis

## The goal

At the end of this module you have taken at least two injected faults from *symptom* to
*verified root cause* to *fix* — and for at least one of them you have written down a
diagnosis (yours or an AI agent's), then **proved or falsified it against the live
cluster before acting**. `./verify.sh` confirms every injected fault is actually fixed.

## Why this matters

Installing things teaches less per minute than debugging things — and in 2026, "debugging"
usually starts with asking an assistant. Assistants are excellent at Kubernetes triage and
*confidently wrong* just often enough to hurt. The skill of the decade is not prompting;
it is **verification**: treating every diagnosis — human or machine — as a hypothesis and
designing the one observation that would kill it. Fair warning: one fault below was
designed so that the obvious AI answer is plausible and wrong.

## The setup

Four faults, in increasing order of deviousness. Each gets its own namespace
(`faultlab-NN`), so your real platform is never touched.

| # | Scenario | Needs | Flavor |
|---|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `01-web-down` | module 01 | a deploy that never comes up |
| 2 | `02-db-stuck` | module 03 (CNPG) | a database frozen mid-birth |
| 3 | `03-db-unreachable` | module 01 | everything healthy, nothing connects |
| 4 | `04-db-flaky` | module 01 | works… sometimes. **The trap.** |

```bash
./inject.sh 1        # start here
./restore.sh 1       # apply the canonical fix / give up gracefully
./restore.sh clean   # delete all fault namespaces when done
```

Each fault dir has `description.md` — **that's the spoiler**, don't open it until you've
committed to a diagnosis. `fix.yaml`/`fix.sh` is the canonical repair.

## The task

For each fault you take on (do at least 1 and 4; all four if time allows):

1. `./inject.sh <n>`, then look at the namespace. Find the *symptom* first
   (`get all`, logs) before hunting causes.
2. **Write down a one-sentence diagnosis** before fixing anything. Literally write it —
   sticky note, scratch file, whatever. "The pod can't X because Y."
3. **Verify it**: what would you observe on the live cluster if your sentence were true?
   Go observe exactly that. If the observation disagrees, your diagnosis is dead —
   write a new one. (This loop is the module.)
4. Fix it — live edit, `kubectl apply`, whatever you like. Re-check the symptom.
5. `./verify.sh` when you're done with all your faults.

### With an AI agent (recommended for at least fault 4)

Give an agent read-only eyes on your cluster and make it do step 1–2 for you — then *you*
do step 3 on its answer:

```bash
./make-readonly-kubeconfig.sh          # writes ./ai-readonly.kubeconfig (4h token)
KUBECONFIG=$PWD/ai-readonly.kubeconfig claude    # or kubectl-ai, k8sgpt analyze, ...
```

A prompt that works well: *"Something is wrong in namespace faultlab-04. Investigate and
give me: (1) your root-cause hypothesis in one sentence, (2) the exact kubectl commands
whose output would prove it, (3) your confidence."* Then run those commands yourself,
against the real cluster, and pass verdict. The deliverable is not the fix — it's the
sentence **"the agent claimed X; I checked Y; the claim was right/wrong because Z."**

No agent handy? Pair up: one of you plays "confident AI", states a diagnosis from the
manifests alone; the other falsifies it against the cluster.

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: A triage order that almost always works</summary>

1. `kubectl -n <ns> get all` — what's *not* green?
2. Pod not Running/Ready → `kubectl describe pod` and read the **Events** bottom-up,
   then `kubectl logs` (add `--previous` after crashes).
3. Pod `Pending` → it's a scheduling/resources/volumes problem, not a code problem.
   Describe it; then follow whatever it references (PVC? node? quota?).
4. Everything green but connections fail → stop staring at pods. Check `endpoints`,
   then DNS, then network policies. Timeout ≠ refused: timeouts smell of policy/firewall,
   refusals smell of "nothing listening there".
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2: Commands for the "network is lying to me" faults</summary>

```bash
kubectl -n <ns> get endpoints <svc>          # who does the Service ACTUALLY route to?
kubectl -n <ns> get pods --show-labels       # do labels match what selectors assume?
kubectl get ciliumnetworkpolicies,netpol -A  # who restricts traffic?
kubectl -n kube-system exec ds/cilium -c cilium-agent -- \
  cilium-dbg monitor --type drop             # watch the datapath drop packets, live
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3: How to interrogate an AI agent properly</summary>

Don't ask "how do I fix it?" — you'll get a fix for *its* hypothesis, not necessarily
your cluster. Ask for a **falsifiable claim + the evidence that would prove it**. If the
agent proposes a fix that "can't hurt anyway": that's a smell. In this module, one fault
punishes exactly that reflex. Fixes that don't follow from a verified cause aren't fixes;
they're superstition with YAML.

<summary>Full solution</summary>

The written-out root causes and canonical repairs live in each fault's spoiler:

- [faults/01-web-down/description.md](faults/01-web-down/description.md)
- [faults/02-db-stuck/description.md](faults/02-db-stuck/description.md)
- [faults/03-db-unreachable/description.md](faults/03-db-unreachable/description.md)
- [faults/04-db-flaky/description.md](faults/04-db-flaky/description.md)

Mechanically: `./restore.sh all` applies every canonical fix; `./restore.sh clean`
removes the namespaces. (CI runs `solve.sh` = inject everything, restore everything.)
</details>

## Check your work

```bash
./verify.sh
```

For every fault namespace that exists it checks the *outcome* (the workload actually
works — availability, DB readiness, and for fault 4: repeated connection attempts, so a
half-fixed trap still fails), and that your platform (demo apps, ArgoCD health) survived
the session.

## Explain-back

Tell your neighbor about fault 4 (or your favorite): what was the *first* diagnosis on
the table, which single command killed or confirmed it, and what would have happened if
you'd applied the fix for the wrong diagnosis?

## Going deeper

- Re-run fault 4 pointing your agent at the cluster *with* read access and ask it again —
  does live access change its answer versus manifest-only reasoning? (This is the whole
  argument for agentic tooling with real cluster eyes, and for keeping it read-only.)
- Design your own fault for your neighbor: same contract (`issue.yaml`, `fix.yaml`,
  `description.md`), must survive their agent's first guess. Hardest part: making it
  *fair*.
- Try `k8sgpt analyze --explain` across a fault namespace and grade its output: right
  cause? right evidence? right fix?
